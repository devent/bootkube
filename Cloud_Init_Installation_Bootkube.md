# Installation of Kubernetes with the help of Bootkube and Cloud-Config

This document describes the steps to install Kubernetes with the help of Bootkube and Cloud-Config on systems:

* prod00kube01.ams01.service.moovel.ibm.com - name node1 - IP 10.104.100.236 - public IP 37.58.99.228
* prod00kube02.ams01.service.moovel.ibm.com - name node2 - IP 10.104.100.245 - public IP 37.58.99.235
* prod00kube03.ams01.service.moovel.ibm.com - name node3 - IP 10.104.100.239 - public IP 37.58.99.238

All three systems will be installed as Kubernetes master. A prerequisite is that a working etcd cluster is installed.
